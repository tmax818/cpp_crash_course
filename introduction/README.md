### Part I: The C++ Core Language

[Chapter 1](../partOne/chapter01/README.md): Up and Running This introductory chapter will help you set up a C++ development environment. You’ll compile and run your first program, and you’ll learn how to debug it.

[Chapter 2](../partOne/chapter02/README.md): Types Here you’ll explore the C++ type system. You’ll learn about the fundamental types, the foundation upon which all other types are built. Next, you’ll learn about plain-old-data types and fully featured classes. You’ll delve into the role of constructors, initialization, and destructors.

Chapter 3: Reference Types This chapter introduces you to objects that store the memory addresses of other objects. These types are the cornerstone of many important programming patterns, and they allow you to produce flexible, efficient code.

Chapter 4: The Object Life Cycle The discussion of class invariants and the constructor is continued within the context of storage durations. The destructor is introduced alongside the [resource acquisition is initialization (RAII)] paradigm. You’ll learn about exceptions and how they enforce class invariants and complement RAII. After a discussion of move and copy semantics, you’ll explore how to operationalize them with constructors and assignment operators.

Chapter 5: Runtime Polymorphism Here you’ll be introduced to interfaces, a programming concept that allows you to write code that’s polymorphic at runtime. You’ll learn the basics of inheritance and object composition, which underpin how you can operationalize interfaces in C++.

Chapter 6: Compile-Time Polymorphism This chapter introduces templates, a language feature that allows you to write polymorphic code. You’ll also explore concepts, a language feature that will be added to a future C++ release, and named conversion functions, which allow you to convert objects from one type to another.

Chapter 7: Expressions Now you’ll dive deeply into operands and operators. With a firm grasp of types, the object life cycle, and templates, you’ll be ready to plunge into the core components of the C++ language, and expressions are the first waypoint.

Chapter 8: Statements This chapter explores the elements that comprise functions. You’ll learn about expression statements, compound statements, declaration statements, iteration statements, and jump statements.

Chapter 9: Functions The final chapter of Part I expands on the discussion of how to arrange statements into units of work. You’ll learn the details of function definitions, return types, overload resolution, variadic functions, variadic templates, and function pointers. You’ll also learn how to create invokable user-defined types using the function call operator and lambda expressions. You’ll explore std::function, a class that provides a uniform container for storing invokable objects.

### Part II: C++ Libraries and Frameworks
