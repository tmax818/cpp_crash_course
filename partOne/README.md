- [Chapter 1](./chapter01/README.md) sets up a working environment and bootstraps some language constructs, including the basics of objects, the primary abstraction you use to program C++.

[Chapter 2]() takes an extensive look at types, the language construct that defines your objects.

[Chapter 3]() extends the discussion of [Chapter 2]() to discuss reference types, which describe objects that refer to other objects.

[Chapter 4]() describes the object life cycle, one of the most powerful aspects of C++.
